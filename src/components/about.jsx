                <p>
                    I am currently in my fourth year as a student at McGill University, pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in Chemical Engineering with a minor in Software Engineering. 
                    I am also heavily interested in global capital markets, investment banking, and finance. 
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    I aspire to develop and build on my foundation through any possible learning opportunities related to these passions.
